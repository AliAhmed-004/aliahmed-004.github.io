Privacy Policy

Effective date: June 7, 2025

Thank you for using Personal Diary. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled within the app.
1. No Data Collection

Personal Diary is a fully offline app. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or diary entries to any server or third party.
2. Local Storage

All your diary entries and personal notes are stored locally on your device using secure internal storage mechanisms, including all backups. You are in full control of your data.
3. Backup & Restore

The app includes a manual backup and restore feature, allowing you to export and import your diary entries in JSON format. These backups are stored locally in a location of your choice. No data is uploaded by the app automatically.
4. Permissions

The app may request permission to access your device storage only for the purpose of exporting or importing your diary backup files, or adding images to a diary entry. This permission is strictly used for this functionality and nothing else.
5. No Third-Party Services

We do not integrate with any analytics, advertising, or third-party SDKs that collect or share your information.
6. Children's Privacy

This app does not knowingly collect personal data from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Since no data is collected, this policy applies universally.
7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Any changes will be posted on this page with a revised effective date.
