SpudByte built the ProgressPal app as an offline productivity tool. This app is provided by us and is intended for use as is.
1. Information Collection and Use

ProgressPal does not collect personally identifiable information from users.

However, certain features may involve temporary data processing:

    AI Goal Generation: If you use this feature, the app sends your entered Track and Goal names to an external AI service to generate suggestions. This data is:
        Not linked to your identity
        Not stored by us
        Not used for tracking or analytics

We do not collect, store, or share any personal data from your device.
2. Permissions

The app requests the following permission:

    Notifications: To remind you to complete your goals. Notifications are optional and controlled by your device settings.

3. Data Safety

    No account is required to use the app.
    All user progress is stored locally on your device.
    We do not use third-party analytics or advertising SDKs.

4. Third-Party Services

The app uses external services only for optional AI-powered goal generation. These services may process the text you input, but are not used for tracking.
5. Security

We value your trust. Although no personal information is collected, we strive to ensure any temporary data is handled securely.

ProgressPal does not knowingly collect data from children under 13.
